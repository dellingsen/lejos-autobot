Autonomous navigation with leJOS, a firmware replacement for Lego Mindstorms programmable bricks.
It includes a Java virtual machine, which allows Lego Mindstorms robots to be programmed in the Java programming language.

A robot can be created using the LEGO Mindstorms NXT programmable robotics kit from Lego, which contains Lego parts
to build a robot along with the leJOS programmable brick.

Using the eclipse IDE, you can create a Java project that can be used to program the leJOS brick to operate the robot,
as well as upload the program to the brick.

There are many, many resources available on the web to start programming your Lego robot, here are a few that I used.
